The goal is to implement a browser-resident image upscaling pipeline that converts an ESRGAN-based PyTorch model into a browser-executable ONNX graph, optimizes it via INT8 quantization, and integrates it into a Manifest V3 browser extension capable of detecting, extracting, and upscaling webpage images (manga panels) using a tiled inference strategy.

The system must:

Execute model inference inside a Web Worker

Use ONNX Runtime Web (WASM/WebGPU) for execution

Avoid blocking the main browser thread

Support dynamic image dimensions via tiling

Maintain sub-500ms latency per 512×512 tile on CPU/WASM baseline
