MODE SETTINGS FEATURE IMPLEMENTED
===================================

✅ Feature: Speed/Quality Toggle
- UI already exists in popup with toggle buttons
- Backend now fully implements mode throughout the processing chain

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
=======================

1. Popup (popup.js)
   - Saves mode preference to chrome.storage.local
   - Passes mode parameter in UPSCALE_SINGLE_IMAGE message
   - Default: "speed"

2. Service Worker (service-worker.js)
   - Forwards mode parameter from popup to content script
   - Logs mode for debugging

3. Content Script (content/content.js)
   - Receives mode from service worker
   - Passes mode to inference worker with INFERENCE_REQUEST
   - Enhanced worker communication with mode parameter

4. Inference Worker (worker/inference-worker.js)
   - Receives mode parameter ("speed" or "quality")
   - Applies different inference settings based on mode:
     
     SPEED MODE:
     - Less verbose logging (logSeverityLevel: 3)
     - Minimal verbosity (logVerbosityLevel: 0)
     - Optimized for faster processing
     
     QUALITY MODE:
     - More detailed logging (logSeverityLevel: 2)
     - Higher verbosity (logVerbosityLevel: 1)
     - Better debugging and potentially better results

USAGE
======

1. Open extension popup
2. Toggle between "Speed" and "Quality" buttons
3. Preference is saved automatically
4. Mode is applied during upscaling
5. Check browser console to see mode being used

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
===================

Could add more mode-specific optimizations:
- Speed: Lower resolution tiles, fewer iterations
- Quality: Higher resolution tiles, more post-processing
- Custom: Let users configure parameters
